### Task 1

Write a script called temperature.py that defines two functions:

1. _convert_cel_to_far()_ which takes one float parameter representing degrees Celsius and returns a float representing the same temperature in degrees Fahrenheit using the following formula:
   _F = C \* 9/5 + 32_
2. _convert_far_to_cel()_ which take one float parameter representing degrees Fahrenheit and returns a float representing the same temperature in degrees Celsius using the following formula:
   _C = (F - 32) \* 5/9_

The script should first prompt the user to enter a temperature in degrees Fahrenheit and then display the temperature converted to Celsius. Then prompt the user to enter a temperature in degrees Celsius and display the temperature converted to Fahrenheit. All converted temperatures should be rounded to 2 decimal places.

Here’s a sample run of the program:

```
Enter a temperature in degrees F: 72
72 degrees F = 22.22 degrees C

Enter a temperature in degrees C: 37
37 degrees C = 98.60 degrees F
```

### Task 2

In this challenge, you will write a program called invest.py that tracks the growing amount of an investment over time.

An initial deposit, called the principal amount, is made. Each year, the amount increases by a fixed percentage, called the annual rate of return.

For example, a principal amount of \$100 with an annual rate of return of 5% increases the first year by \$5. The second year, the increase is 5% of the new amount \$105, which is \$5.25.

Write a function called invest with three parameters: the principal amount, the annual rate of return, and the number of years to calculate. The function signature might look something like this:

```python
def invest(amount, rate, years):
```

The function then prints out the amount of the investment, rounded to 2 decimal places, at the end of each year for the specified number of years.

For example, calling _invest(100, .05, 4)_ should print the following:

```
year 1: $105.00
year 2: $110.25
year 3: $115.76
year 4: $121.55
```

To finish the program, prompt the user to enter an initial amount, an annual percentage rate, and a number of years. Then call invest() to display the calculations for the values entered by the user.

### Task 3

A factor of a positive integer n is any positive integer less than or equal to n that divides n with no remainder.

For example, 3 is a factor of 12 because 12 divided by 3 is 4, with no remainder. However, 5 is not a factor of 12 because 5 goes into 12 twice with a remainder of 2.

Write a script factors.py that asks the user to input a positive integer and then prints out the factors of that number. Here’s a sample run of the program with output:

```
Enter a positive integer: 12
1 is a factor of 12
2 is a factor of 12
3 is a factor of 12
4 is a factor of 12
6 is a factor of 12
12 is a factor of 12
```

### Task 4

Write a program that contains the following lists of lists:

```python
universities = [
    ['California Institute of Technology', 2175, 37704],
    ['Harvard', 19627, 39849],
    ['Massachusetts Institute of Technology', 10566, 40732],
    ['Princeton', 7802, 37000],
    ['Rice', 5879, 35551],
    ['Stanford', 19535, 40569],
    ['Yale', 11701, 40500]
]
```

Define a function, _enrollment_stats()_, that akes, as an input, a list of lists where each individual list contains three elements: (a) the name of a university, (b) the total number of enrolled students, and (c) the annual tuition fees.

_enrollment_stats()_ should return two lists: the first containing all of the student enrollment values and the second containing all of the tuition fees.

Next, define a _mean()_ and a _median()_ function. Both functions should take a single list as an argument and return the mean and median of the values in each list.

Using universities, _enrollment_stats()_, _mean()_, and _median()_, calculate the total number of students, the total tuition, the mean and median of the number of students, and the mean and median tuition values.

Finally, output all values, and format the output so that it looks like this:

```
******************************
Total students: 77,285
Total tuition: $ 271,905

Student mean: 11,040.71
Student median: 10,566

Tuition mean: $ 38,843.57
Tuition median: $ 39,849
******************************
```

### Task 5

Define a function `is_prime(n)` which returns `True` if the given $n$ ($n$ > 0) is _prime number_, otherwise returns `False`.
