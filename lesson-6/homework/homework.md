### **Employee Records Manager**

**Objective**: Create a program to manage employee records using file handling.

**Tasks**:

1. **File Creation and Data Entry**

   - Allow the user to add new employee records. Each record should have the following fields:

     ```
     Employee ID, Name, Position, Salary
     ```

     Example of a record:
     ```
     1001, John Doe, Software Engineer, 75000
     ```
2. **Menu Options**
   Your program should present the following options:

   ```
   1. Add new employee record
   2. View all employee records
   3. Search for an employee by Employee ID
   4. Update an employee's information
   5. Delete an employee record
   6. Exit
   ```
3. **Functional Requirements**

   - **Option 1**: Append a new employee record to **"employees.txt"**.
   - **Option 2**: Display all employee records from **"employees.txt"**.
   - **Option 3**: Allow the user to search for an employee by **Employee ID** and display their details.
   - **Option 4**: Update an employeeâ€™s information (name, position, or salary) based on the Employee ID.
   - **Option 5**: Delete an employee's record from the file using the Employee ID.
   - **Option 6**: Exit the program.

### **Word Frequency Counter**

**Objective**: Analyze a text file and count how often each word appears.

**Tasks**:

1. **File Input**

   - Use the file **"sample.txt"**. The file can contain any text (like a paragraph or an article).
   - If **"sample.txt"** does not exist, prompt the user to create it by typing in a paragraph.
2. **Count Word Frequency**

   - Read the file content and split it into individual words.
   - Count the frequency of each word (ignore capitalization, e.g., "The" and "the" should be counted as the same word).
   - Ignore punctuation (like commas, periods, etc.).
3. **Output**

   - Display the total number of words in the file.
   - Display the top 5 most common words with their counts.
   - Save the output to a new file called **"word_count_report.txt"**.
4. **Example Output**
   **Content of sample.txt**:

   ```
   This is a simple file.
   This file, is for testing purposes. It is a test file.
   ```

   **Console Output**:

   ```
   Total words: 14
   Top 5 most common words:
   is - 3 times
   this - 2 times
   file - 3 times
   a - 2 times
   test - 1 time
   ```

   **Content of word_count_report.txt**:

   ```
   Word Count Report
   Total Words: 14
   Top 5 Words:
   is - 3
   file - 3
   this - 2
   a - 2
   test - 1
   ```

**Bonus Task**:

- Allow the user to specify how many "top common words" to display (e.g., top 3, top 10, etc.).
- Make sure the program ignores case, punctuation, and handles large files efficiently.
