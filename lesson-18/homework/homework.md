### Homework: Pandas Basics

#### Part 1: Reading Files

1. **`chinook.db`**

   - Use the `sqlite3` library to connect to the database.
   - Read the `customers` table into a pandas DataFrame. Display the first 10 rows.
2. **`iris.json`**

   - Load the JSON file into a DataFrame. Show the shape of the dataset and the column names.
3. **`titanic.xlsx`**

   - Load the Excel file into a DataFrame. Use `head` to display the first 5 rows.
4. **Flights parquet file**

   - Read the Parquet file into a DataFrame and use `info` to summarize it.
5. **`movie.csv`**

   - Load the CSV file into a DataFrame and display a random sample of 10 rows.

#### Part 2: Exploring DataFrames

1. Using the DataFrame from **`iris.json`**:

   - Rename the columns to lowercase.
   - Select only the `sepal_length` and `sepal_width` columns.
2. From the **`titanic.xlsx`** DataFrame:

   - Filter rows where the age of passengers is above 30.
   - Count the number of male and female passengers (`value_counts`).
3. From the **Flights parquet file**:

   - Extract and print only the `origin`, `dest`, and `carrier` columns.
   - Find the number of unique destinations.
4. From the **`movie.csv`** file:

   - Filter rows where `duration` is greater than 120 minutes.
   - Sort the filtered DataFrame by `director_facebook_likes` in descending order.

#### Part 3: Challenges and Explorations

- From **`iris.json`**: Calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation for each numerical column.
- From **`titanic.xlsx`**: Find the minimum, maximum, and sum of passenger ages.
- From **`movie.csv`**:

  - Identify the director with the highest total `director_facebook_likes`.
  - Find the 5 longest movies and their respective directors.
- From **Flights parquet file**:

  - Check for missing values in the dataset. Fill missing values in a numerical column with the columnâ€™s mean.
